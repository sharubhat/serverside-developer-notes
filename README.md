# Serverside developer's study notes

Every day at work presents a new challenge, an opportunity to learn something new. It's only natural to learn something new and forget at the same rate. My aim is to make this notebook my go-to place for topics that I would need to often refer to. Most of these notes are from reading books, blogs or software documentations. I will try to give reference to origianl source in future notes but it would be missing in my older notes.
