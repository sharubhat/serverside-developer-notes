# Python basics

I need to decide whether to learn python2 or 3 by the time I finish this paragraph. The most confusing part is to decide whether to learn python2 or python3. From what I have read so far, they are not compatible with each other. Most of existing modules are in python2 as it's more popular but it's probably a good idea to move forward. My goal is to get up and running quickly.

Well, I am going to learn python3. So this notes will be all about Python-3. BUT, if I run into serious issues and need to fall back to version2 midway, I may choose to do that.

**Tools:**

Will begin with IDLE that's supplied with python. Coming from java world, I am a fan of jetbrains products. So will soon switch to pycharm community edition.
